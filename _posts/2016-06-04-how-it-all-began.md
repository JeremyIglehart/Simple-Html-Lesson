title: How It All Began
---

<h1>Hello World...</h1>
<h2>The Beginning</h2>
<p>
  Let's go back to where it all began in New Jersey.  I was just a young boy, bored in New Jersey, and I had a computer.
</p>
<p>
  One day, my parents decided they had enough money to either buy a new computer, or get the internet.  Of course, because of the inner geek, I thought... New computer means I can play cooler better games... DUH - I want a new computer.
</p>
<p>
  But then, my brother said "Dude, you don't understand... The internet is such a cool thing to get.  You can connect your computer to all the other computers out there in the world... and... do thing, much cooler than a faster computer.  We should get <em>The Internet</em>".
